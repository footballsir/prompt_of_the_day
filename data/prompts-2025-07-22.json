The art direction channels *Mars Attacks!*—satirical, exaggerated, colorful, yet grotesquely comical. In the foreground, panicked civilians in vintage-styled clothing — poodle skirts, horn-rimmed glasses, shiny suits — flee in all directions, their faces frozen in over-the-top expressions of terror. Some trip over debris, others scream upward at unseen attackers. A woman drops her tiny dog, who also yaps in cartoonish panic. Flames and black smoke billow from twisted metal structures. Amongst the rubble, several half-destroyed futuristic billboards flicker and spark. One prominently reads: **“TRY VEO 3 NOW ON PROMPTHERO”** The bold retro-futuristic font flashes intermittently, with part of the sign hanging loose, swaying dangerously. In the midground, a toppled hovercar smolders, while strange saucer-shaped ships hover ominously, firing neon-colored beams that disintegrate buildings into clouds of pixel-like dust. In the background, a cracked glass dome reveals a monstrous, oversized martian head leering down, its brain pulsating beneath a transparent helmet. The lighting is unnatural — sharp, high-contrast, with surreal, saturated colors that make the destruction feel both comedic and horrifying, true to *Mars Attacks!*’ satirical aesthetic.",

    "content": "The scene explodes with the raw, visceral, and unpredictable energy of a hardcore off-road rally, captured with a dynamic, almost found-footage or embedded sports documentary aesthetic. The camera is often shaky, seemingly mounted inside one of the vehicles or held by a daring spectator very close to the action, frequently splattered with mud or water, catching unintentional lens flares from the natural, often harsh, sunlight filtering through trees or reflecting off wet surfaces. We are immersed in a challenging, untamed natural environment – perhaps a dense, muddy forest trail, a treacherous rocky incline littered with loose scree, or a series_of shallow, fast-flowing river crossings. Several heavily modified, entirely unidentifiable, and unbranded off-road vehicles are engaged in a frenetic, no-holds-barred race. These are not showroom models; they are custom-built, rugged machines – open-wheeled buggies with exposed engines and prominent roll cages, heavily armored pickup trucks with oversized, knobby tires and snorkel exhausts, their original forms and manufacturers completely obscured by extreme modifications, layers of caked-on mud, and a general air of brutal functionality. The dominant sounds are the deafening, guttural roar of powerful, untamed engines, the whine of transmissions, the percussive impact of suspension bottoming out, and the constant spray of mud and water. Within an 8-second sequence, one of the lead vehicles, a low-slung, open-cockpit buggy so caked in thick, brown mud that its original color is a mystery, approaches a wide, shallow river crossing at incredible speed. Without the slightest hesitation, its unseen driver powers straight into the water. The impact sends an enormous, almost solid, opaque sheet of muddy water, mixed with stones and debris from the riverbed, spectacularly high into the air, completely engulfing the small buggy for a terrifying moment, obscuring it from view as if it has been swallowed by the river itself. Right on its tail, a pursuing, equally mud-encrusted, custom-built truck – a hulking, high-clearance beast with a heavily reinforced external roll cage and no discernible badging – arrives at the river crossing just as this massive wall of airborne water reaches its peak. Instead of slowing or attempting to find a clearer path, the truck's driver, with unwavering aggression, plunges directly into and through this opaque, turbulent curtain of muddy spray at full throttle. A split second later, the truck bursts out from the other side of the deluge, water cascading from its roof and chassis, its oversized windshield wipers struggling frantically to clear the torrent of muddy water obscuring the driver's vision. It lands heavily on the far bank, suspension groaning, but still in hot pursuit of the now-reappearing buggy. This thrilling, messy, and visually spectacular sequence of one vehicle creating a massive environmental obstacle and the next immediately conquering it through sheer force, forms the core, immersive, attention-grabbing event of the 8-second sequence. The race continues with undiminished ferocity, the natural terrain itself an active participant in the conflict.",

    "content": "An ethereal, cinematic portrait of an impossibly beautiful woman seen fleetingly at an airport—a face that lingers in your memory like a ghost of a dream, never to be seen again. She stands frozen in time at the heart of the image, delicate and soft, with porcelain skin and flowing hair gently caught by an unseen breeze. Her expression is distant, introspective, as if she’s not fully part of the world around her. Around her, the airport pulses with blurred motion—travelers rushing by in streaks of abstract colors and bokeh lights, emphasizing the stillness of her presence. The chaos of human movement becomes an impressionistic whirlpool of life, but she remains untouched, a fragile island of serenity in the storm. The atmosphere is dreamlike, whispy, and soft focus, with cinematic depth of field that isolates her figure in the center—sharp yet veiled in a gentle haze, as if remembered through fogged glass. The colors are muted pastels with hints of teal, beige, and soft golden highlights, evoking the bittersweet feeling of something beautiful slipping away. Composition captures her from slightly below eye level, adding a sense of reverence and loss. Use subtle film grain, motion blur for the surroundings, and a delicate lens flare cutting through from overhead fluorescent lights. The scene is crafted to feel like a memory you can't quite place—fragile, aching, eternal. Shot with a Leica M11 paired with a vintage 50mm f/0.95 Noctilux lens, aperture wide open at f/0.95 to create an impossibly shallow depth of field, ISO 320, shutter speed 1/125 sec—designed to capture the surreal interplay of stillness and movement, focus and blur, presence and absence.",

A lean Indian man in his early 30s, dust-covered white kurta flapping in the wind, bare feet gripping the rusted top of a freight train wagon as it speeds through rural India. Late afternoon golden hour, with warm low sunlight casting elongated shadows across dried grass fields and distant banyan trees. In the distance, a dark stone bridge looms rapidly ahead. The man, drenched in sweat, eyes wide, doesn’t flinch—his jaw tightens as the camera tilts slightly to emphasize the shrinking space between his head and the arch. Background blurs as the train barrels forward, wheels clanking louder, tension building with every screech of metal on rail. Just as his skull seems seconds from cracking against stone, the camera abruptly cuts to a side dolly shot revealing a hidden gap between his head and the archway—only inches, but enough. The illusion breaks; the man passes under safely. His chest heaves once. Lighting remains warm but dappled, with slight lens flare from the sun streaking across frame. Emotional tone: Pure tension giving way to breathless relief. Audio cues: Rising train noise, ambient wind, an eagle’s cry overhead, distant horns. A sharp whoosh as the train clears the bridge, followed by the fading echo of rails humming. Color Palette: Earth tones, sun-baked yellows and browns, deep shadowed grays from the bridge. Dialogue: None. The silence after the near miss says everything. shot in cinematic style.",

The koala clutches a bunch of bananas in its tiny paws but looks furious, as if offended by the offering. The zookeeper, wearing a uniform and holding an empty fruit basket, steps back in shock. Natural sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft shadows. The koala’s expressive eyes and detailed fur should look lifelike, with subtle movements like twitching nose and aggressive posturing. Surrounding environment includes realistic zoo sounds (birds, distant chatter) for immersion.\"* ### **Enhancements for Realism:** - **Cinematic Lighting** – Soft golden-hour glow for dramatic effect. - **Micro-Expressions** – Koala’s face should show clear annoyance (narrowed eyes, flared nostrils). - **Dynamic Camera Angle** – Slightly low-angle shot to emphasize the koala’s defiance. - **Sound Design** – Add koala growls, rustling leaves, and the zookeeper’s surprised gasp. ### **Ideal AI Tools for This:** - **Runway Gen-2 / Pika Labs** – For high-quality video generation. - **DALL·E 3 / MidJourney** – For concept art before video rendering. - **Adobe Premiere Pro** – Post-processing for sound & effects.",

The camera glides just above the water’s surface, capturing soft ripples, floating leaves, and golden reflections. Gentle ambient nature sounds – insects, distant howler monkeys, the occasional splash. As the camera reaches the center of the river, it slowly tilts downward and transitions seamlessly below the surface. Crystal-clear turquoise water reveals an enchanting underwater world. Shafts of sunlight break through the surface, creating dancing light patterns on the riverbed. Small tropical fish swim gracefully between smooth stones, aquatic plants, and sunken roots. Tiny bubbles rise, and the water feels tranquil and alive. Everything is rich in detail: textured rocks, floating particles, gently moving algae. The atmosphere is peaceful, magical, and immersive.

The girl, around 19 years old, has a beautiful glowing caramel skin tone, expressive eyes, and a soft innocent smile on her youthful face. Her hair is tied neatly back and adorned with fresh jasmine flowers (gajra). She is dressed in a traditional Indian lehenga voni—a rich magenta pink blouse with elbow-length sleeves and golden embroidery and mirror work, a mustard yellow silk lehenga with elegant pleats and a thick golden border, and a light mint green netted dupatta with golden trim and beadwork flowing gracefully over her shoulder. She wears traditional gold jewelry, including jhumkas, a necklace, bangles, and a hathphool (hand chain). The boy, around 21 years old, has a soft wheatish Indian complexion, a light stubble, short tousled hair, and a charming smile filled with warmth and love. He is dressed in a casual cream linen shirt with sleeves rolled up and light brown trousers, barefoot in the sand. The couple is joyfully focused on shaping a grand Raj Kota sandcastle featuring tall spires, arched gates, mini staircases, domes, and layered fort walls—realistic in royal Indian architecture style. The entire sandcastle is enclosed inside a huge heart shape drawn in the sand, symbolizing their love. The girl is shaping a tall tower, smiling sweetly, while the boy is pressing and shaping the base wall, looking at her with admiration. Behind them, the majestic limestone cliff covered in lush greenery rises above the calm, turquoise ocean waves. The sky is lightly overcast with soft golden sunlight, creating a dreamy, cinematic beach atmosphere. The mood is full of innocent affection, emotional bonding, and playful teamwork, showing how the two lovers build not just a castle, but a memory of their love. The entire scene is captured in 16:9 aspect ratio, like a perfect still from a beautiful love story.",

Sunbeams pierce through the towering redwoods. Slight breeze rustles leaves. 2. Detailed Scene Action Bigfoot, towering and shaggy, holds a smartphone on a selfie stick. He walks toward camera, deadpan expression, adjusting the mic like a pro. He pauses, then delivers the joke: “Why don’t I go to parties? Because every time I try, someone yells ‘I found him!’” He lets the punchline hang, raises his eyebrows, then chuckles with a deep, guttural laugh. 3. Optional Dialogue/Voiceover [Bigfoot, mock-serious tone] “Look, I’m just tryin’ to live my life, man. I like moss. I like mushrooms. I tell jokes. But every time… boom — blurry photo, viral panic.” 4. Camera Style and Movement Handheld selfie-style from Bigfoot’s POV, with occasional over-the-shoulder drone cuts to show his massive frame amid the trees. Occasional quick zoom-ins for comedic timing. Shaky-cam adds realism. 5. Audio/Musical Elements Lighthearted acoustic guitar plucks. Ambient forest SFX — birds, wind, distant woodpecker. Comedic record-scratch sound when he tells the joke, followed by a short laugh track. 6. Mood, Lighting, Cinematic Style Whimsical mockumentary vibe. Soft natural lighting with mild cinematic grading (slight green-gold tint). Feels like a cross between a National Geographic special and a YouTube skit.",

The koala clutches a bunch of bananas in its tiny paws but looks furious, as if offended by the offering. The zookeeper, wearing a uniform and holding an empty fruit basket, steps back in shock. Natural sunlight filters through the trees, casting soft shadows. The koala’s expressive eyes and detailed fur should look lifelike, with subtle movements like twitching nose and aggressive posturing. Surrounding environment includes realistic zoo sounds (birds, distant chatter) for immersion.\"* ### **Enhancements for Realism:** - **Cinematic Lighting** – Soft golden-hour glow for dramatic effect. - **Micro-Expressions** – Koala’s face should show clear annoyance (narrowed eyes, flared nostrils). - **Dynamic Camera Angle** – Slightly low-angle shot to emphasize the koala’s defiance. - **Sound Design** – Add koala growls, rustling leaves, and the zookeeper’s surprised gasp. ### **Ideal AI Tools for This:** - **Runway Gen-2 / Pika Labs** – For high-quality video generation. - **DALL·E 3 / MidJourney** – For concept art before video rendering. - **Adobe Premiere Pro** – Post-processing for sound & effects.",

    "content": "\"Ultra-realistic, Highly Detailed Digital Painting / Photorealistic Illustration of Pierre Louis Dulong\" Image Type: Ultra-realistic digital painting / Photorealistic illustration. (This clarifies the artistic medium, rather than a literal photograph). Overall Artistic Style: Highly detailed, reminiscent of a classical historical portrait, specifically a hand-colored engraving or lithograph. The rendering should achieve photorealistic quality for the subject's features while retaining the characteristic texture and coloring of such historical artworks, with a rich, almost cinematic illustrative quality. Likeness: Very strong and precise likeness to the provided historical portrait of Pierre Louis Dulong . Lighting: Soft, even, and natural-looking light, similar to an old studio portrait setup. The main light source should be subtly from the front-left or front-right, gently highlighting facial contours. Gentle fill light should soften any shadows. Avoid harsh shadows or overexposure. Depth of Field: Shallow depth of field to ensure the subject's face is in crisp, primary focus, with a softly blurred background that does not distract. Color Palette: Natural, rich, and historically appropriate colors. Emphasize warm yet slightly muted skin tones, vibrant deep blue eyes, and deep, textured clothing colors consistent with the original historical rendering. Subject Details: Age: Depicted as a man in his late 40s to early 50s. Expression: Calm, discerning, and contemplative. A dignified and intelligent gaze directed straight towards the viewer. Face Shape: Rounded but well-defined, with a strong, clean jawline. Hair: Color: Light ash blonde or rich golden-blonde, with subtle natural highlights and tonal variations. Style: Very thick, distinctly wavy to curly, appearing full around the head and ears. It should not be strictly swept back but rather voluminous and natural, as seen in the reference image. Sideburns: Very dense and full, extending low to cover a significant portion of the cheek, with defined but not razor-sharp edges, conveying a natural, bushy volume as in the original. Eyes: Color: Strikingly bright, deep blue, with clear whites and a focused pupil. Shape: Wide and slightly rounded, with an intelligent and direct gaze. Eyebrows: Moderately thick, naturally arched, and neatly groomed, precisely matching the hair color, enhancing the eye's expression. Nose: Straight, with a slightly broad bridge and a softly rounded tip. It should appear strong and proportional to his face. Mouth and Lips: Medium-full lips, naturally shaped, with a neutral to slightly contemplative expression, showing subtle definition. Chin: Clearly defined and proportional, projecting slightly, contributing to a strong and somewhat squarish lower face. Facial Pose: Direct frontal view, with a very subtle (1-2 degree) tilt clockwise, precisely mimicking the angle in the reference image. Clothing Details: Coat: A single-breasted (or not visibly double-breasted) wool frock coat in a deep, muted burgundy (dark reddish-purple) or deep maroon color. The fabric should exhibit a fine, tight, textured weave, characteristic of historical prints (e.g., a subtle stippled or cross-hatched appearance), not a smooth modern fabric. The lapels should be broad and well-defined. Cravat/Collar: A pristine white, high, stiff linen cravat or stock, wrapped neatly and tightly around the neck. Inner Garments/Tie: A small visible portion of a dark inner vest or waistcoat. A striped tie, with vertical stripes in dark, muted colors (e.g., dark red and brown), should be visible at the neck opening. Background & Atmosphere: Background: A soft, plain very light blue-grey background. Crucially, the background should feature a distinct stippled or cross-hatched texture, characteristic of historical engravings or lithographs, rather than a smooth, seamless sky. There should be minimal or no noticeable gradual shading effects. Overall Mood/Atmosphere: Calm, confident, and contemplative, conveying a sense of intellectual dignity and solemnity. Rendering Quality (Crucial for replication): Resolution: 8K resolution. Detail: Extreme textural detail for all elements: individual strands of hair, realistic skin texture (portraying it as a finely rendered surface, not smooth plastic), and the intricate weave/texture of his clothing. Color Gradations: Natural and subtle color gradations within the chosen artistic style. Lighting Definition: Clear and well-defined lighting that shapes the forms without harshness. Focus: A shallow depth of field to keep the primary focus on the subject.",

    "content": "Image Type: Digital photograph, formal portrait. Overall Photographic Style: Photorealistic, high-resolution, sharp focus on the subject's face, professional and classic portraiture. The style emphasizes clarity, detail, and a timeless quality. Lighting: Soft, even, and diffused lighting. The main light source appears to be from the front-left, creating subtle highlights on the forehead, cheekbones, and the top of the hair. There are gentle, soft shadows on the right side of the face, defining contours without being harsh. The overall illumination is balanced and natural. Depth of Field: Shallow to moderate depth of field. The subject's face and upper body are in sharp focus, while the background is subtly blurred, providing a soft, indistinct backdrop that keeps the focus entirely on the subject. Color Palette: Monochromatic (black and white tones). The image exhibits a rich grayscale range, with deep blacks in the suit, bright whites in the hair and shirt collar, and a full spectrum of nuanced mid-grays, contributing to a sense of depth and texture. Subject Details: Age: Middle-aged to elderly man, appearing to be in his late 40s to 60s. Expression: Serious, direct, and intelligent gaze. His eyes are fixed straight ahead, conveying a sense of focus and possibly deep thought. There is no discernible smile. Face Shape: Oval to slightly rectangular, with a broad forehead and a prominent jawline. Hair: Neatly combed and parted on the left side (from the viewer's perspective). It is thick and appears to have a slight wave or volume, especially towards the front. Hair Color: Light-colored hair, appearing white or very light gray in this grayscale image. Hair Style: Short to medium length, combed back from the forehead on both sides, with a clear side parting. Eyes: Appears to be light-colored (possibly blue or grey, given the grayscale). They are almond-shaped with well-defined eyelids, and appear to be deep-set. Eyebrows: Medium thickness, relatively straight, and also light-colored (white/gray), matching the hair. Nose: Straight, prominent, with a well-defined bridge and nostrils. Mouth and Lips: Hidden mostly by a thick mustache. What is visible of the lips appears thin and set in a firm line. Chin: Broad and rounded, with a slight cleft or dimple visible in the center. Distinguishing Features: A prominent, thick, and well-groomed mustache that extends horizontally beyond the corners of his mouth. Body and Clothing Details: Pose: Upper body portrait, showing the head, shoulders, and upper chest. The subject is angled slightly to the right (from the viewer's perspective), with his head turned to look directly forward. His posture is upright and formal. Clothing: Dressed in a dark, formal suit jacket, likely made of wool or a similar textured fabric. Beneath the jacket, a light-colored collared shirt is visible, with a dark, perhaps patterned, necktie fastened with a decorative tie pin or clasp. A dark waistcoat might be partially visible under the jacket. Background: A plain, solid-colored backdrop, likely a medium gray or dark neutral tone. It is uniformly lit and appears smooth, without any patterns, objects, or discernible features, ensuring the subject is the sole focus. Overall Mood/Atmosphere: Formal, dignified, intellectual, serious, and classic. It evokes a sense of authority and academic presence.``",

Surrounding panels: diverse rectangular sections in wildly different aspect ratios — tall and narrow, wide and short, and square — each illustrating parallel stories, memories, or alternate realities in distinct art styles ranging from surrealism to realism. Hidden text layers: cryptic, handwritten or ancient script texts subtly integrated, some barely visible and only revealed when zoomed in, adding mystery and depth to the plot. Mirrored ambigram section: an area that flips upside down or reflects to reveal a contrasting interpretation of the central character or theme, emphasizing duality and hidden truths. Color transitions: a smooth gradient shifts from warm fiery tones on one side of the canvas to cool ethereal blues on the opposite side, highlighting emotional and temporal changes throughout the story. Recurring symbols (like a glowing orb, fractal tree, or mysterious key) appear across the canvas, linking the different story threads visually and thematically. The style mixes intricate linework, painterly textures, and vibrant color palettes to create a rich, immersive narrative tapestry that invites exploration, interpretation, and repeated viewing.",

He has a full, well-groomed beard and mustache that are a medium brown or dark blonde color, with hints of gray or silver, connecting neatly across his face. His hair is short to medium length, neatly combed back and slightly parted on the left side, appearing thick and slightly wavy, and matching the color of his beard (medium brown/dark blonde with subtle gray/silver tones). His expression is intense, direct, and thoughtful, with his eyes fixed straight ahead, looking directly towards the viewer, conveying deep intellectual engagement and solemnity. His face shape is oval to slightly elongated, with a moderately broad forehead, well-defined cheekbones, and a lean appearance. His eyes are a striking medium blue or deep grey color, deeply set under prominent brow ridges, giving them an intense and penetrating quality. His eyebrows are medium thickness, distinct, and follow a relatively straight line, matching his hair and beard color. His nose is prominent, straight, and relatively long, with a defined bridge. His mouth and chin are completely hidden by his full beard and mustache. His right hand is raised, with his fingers gently resting against his chin or lower jawline, suggesting a contemplative or pensive mood. He is impeccably dressed in a dark, formal suit jacket (e.g., deep charcoal gray or navy blue, with a subtle texture of fine wool). Beneath the jacket, a crisp, bright white collared dress shirt is visible. A dark, solid-colored (e.g., black or very dark blue) necktie is neatly fastened at his collar. The lighting is soft, even, and diffused studio lighting. The main light source is positioned slightly above and to the front-left, creating subtle, delicate highlights on the forehead, the top of the head, and the left cheekbone. Gentle, soft shadows fall on the right side of the face, under the nose, and within the beard, defining contours without harshness. The overall illumination is balanced and volumetric, bringing out realistic skin tones (fair to medium with natural undertones) and fabric textures. The depth of field is extremely shallow (very strong bokeh effect). The man's face, every strand of his hair and beard, and the immediate details of his suit are in razor-sharp focus. The background is rendered as an entirely smooth, indistinct wash of color, a dark, muted neutral tone (e.g., deep charcoal or dark forest green), completely devoid of any patterns or features, providing maximum subject isolation and a painterly quality to the blur. The overall mood/atmosphere is deeply intellectual, serious, contemplative, dignified, and classically timeless. The portrait exudes an aura of profound scientific thought, authority, and historical significance.",

Her pose is dynamic and full of intensity, her torso twisted, arms spread outward in a stance that suggests power and defiance. Her eyes are fixed directly ahead, with an unyielding gaze, and an expression that blends wrath and resilience. She’s dressed in scorched, tattered clothing, barely clinging to her figure in burnt strips that ripple with heat and expose much of her form, including one bare breast. barefoot. The charred remnants of fabric smolder along the edges, with faint embers glowing in the seams, as if she’s emerged from a firestorm. Ash and soot streak her skin, mingling with the dark patches of burns, giving her an appearance of gritty resilience. From her eyes and mouth, molten lava pours out in a slow, thick flow—a relentless torrent of glowing, molten rock spilling from her eyes like fiery tears and streaming down her chin from her open mouth. The lava is thick and vivid, with deep, pulsing reds and oranges, illuminating her face with a harsh, otherworldly light. The heat rising from her body distorts the air, casting smoky trails and faint wisps around her as if she’s engulfed in her own fiery aura. Around her, the rocky ground is covered with low-lying mist and smoke, hovering just above the surface, while subtle veins of lava pulse beneath the ground, casting a faint red glow through the mist like the earth's own blood. The volcanic terrain is punctuated by deep craters and rocky outcroppings, with hints of molten light seeping from below, giving the land a dangerous, primordial energy. Above her head, a brilliantly glowing atomic symbol floats, radiating a haunting atomic-green light. This symbol is surrounded by equations, scientific formulas, and symbols of physics that orbit like a crown of knowledge, each one glowing faintly and pulsing in sync with her energy. The symbols are both beautiful and ominous, casting an ethereal glow around her face and adding to her mystical, almost godlike aura. Embers and glowing particles swirl through the air around her, drifting in the rising heat like fiery snowflakes, glowing faintly and leaving trails of light as they move. These sparks catch the light from the veins of lava below, creating a dynamic, layered effect that makes the scene feel alive and chaotic. The landscape and the embers are rendered in hyperrealistic detail, capturing every texture from the scorched ground to the molten flow pouring from her eyes and mouth. Rendering Style: Hyperrealistic and cinematic, with a strong emphasis on dynamic lighting and fine detail. The scene combines gritty textures and vibrant glows, achieving a powerful balance between earthly elements and mystical symbolism. A masterpiece worthy of ArtStation, capturing the raw, untamed energy and ethereal might of this formidable figure.",

At the center stands a powerful, seductive woman with wolf-like features, embodying the essence of a femme fatale. Her piercing, glowing eyes, radiating a mix of menace and allure, are framed by long, flowing hair that cascades like a shadowy veil. She wears a tattered yet regal black and crimson cloak that combines gothic elegance with ancient warrior aesthetics, exuding primal authority and raw charisma. Surrounding her, shadowy the enormous giant wolves with glowing eyes materialize from the swirling mist, their forms barely visible yet undeniably menacing, further emphasizing her commanding presence. The twisted, gnarled trees of the forest cast ominous silhouettes, their branches stretching like claws under the eerie, silver light of a massive full moon dominating the sky. The moonlight bathes the scene in an otherworldly glow, illuminating the woman’s figure and the subtle textures of her cloak while casting deep, dramatic shadows. The color palette is dark and evocative, with deep blacks, blood reds, and metallic silvers blending seamlessly to create a surreal and heavy-metal-inspired aesthetic. The mist hangs thick in the air, catching faint moonbeams and adding depth and mystery to the composition. The woman’s stance is both regal and predatory, capturing themes of manipulation, betrayal, and primal power. The overall style is highly atmospheric, dramatic, and detailed, with intricate textures on her cloak, the enormous giant wolves' fur, and the forest floor.

There should be absolutely no sharp edges or lines; all forms of the foxes and their attire (if any) should be suggested by subtle shifts in color washes and the play of light, merging softly with an atmospheric background. The fox figures should be almost translucent, fleeting impressions, barely defined. The scene must feature a palette dominated by soft, hazy reds, whites, and subtle warm tones, creating a warm, dream-like, and cohesive atmosphere reminiscent of a cherished, faded memory.

    "content": "[Image Type: Black and white photograph / Colorized historical photograph / Artistic digital painting / Realistic oil painting] of Marie Curie. General Appearance (combining various depictions): Age: Depicted in her adult years, ranging from younger (late 20s - 30s) to slightly older (40s - 50s). Expression: Predominantly serious, contemplative, and intelligent. Her gaze is direct and focused, conveying deep thought and determination. There is often a subtle intensity in her eyes. Facial Details: Face Shape: Oval to slightly heart-shaped, with defined but soft cheekbones. Skin Tone: Fair complexion. In black and white photos, rendered in smooth grayscale tones. In colorized or painted versions, a natural, healthy tone with subtle rosy undertones, showing realistic skin texture and very fine lines that suggest experience rather than age. Hair: Color: In grayscale, a range from dark to medium gray for her textured hair. In color, a blend of medium brown and light ash-blonde/dirty blonde, often with a hint of gray, especially as she appears older. Style: Typically styled in an elegant updo, often a chignon or a voluminous bun at the back or crown of her head. The hair has a soft, sometimes slightly frizzy or unruly texture around the face and temples, giving it a natural, intellectual look. A subtle side part may be visible. Eyes: Color: In black and white/grayscale, light and clear. In colorized or painted versions, a striking light blue or blue-grey. Shape: Almond-shaped, deep-set, with a penetrating and thoughtful gaze. Her eyes are a prominent feature, conveying her intelligence. Eyebrows: Medium thickness, naturally arched, and well-defined, matching hair color (darker in younger depictions, lighter/grayer in older ones). Eyelashes are subtle. Nose: Straight, well-proportioned, with a slightly refined tip. Mouth and Lips: Medium fullness, usually closed in a neutral or slightly pursed expression, indicating seriousness or concentration. In color, natural muted pink. Chin: Softly rounded, balancing the face. Body and Clothing Details: Posture: Often depicted with a dignified and upright posture, whether standing or seated. When seated, she might be resting her hand gently on her face or arm. Clothing: Typically wears formal, conservative attire from the late 19th or early 20th century. Dress/Jacket: Dark-colored (black, deep navy, or dark brown) often with a textured fabric. The style may feature modest necklines. Collars: A notable feature is often a high white collar, sometimes decorative with vertical pleats or ruffles (as seen in the sitting colorized photo). Accessories: Occasionally wears a simple, elegant necklace with a pendant (e.g., a locket or a scientific-themed piece). Sleeves might be slightly puffed or have subtle detailing. Background and Lighting: Background: Varies from plain, dark, and simple studio backdrops (grayscale or muted tones) to subtly textured or abstract backgrounds (as in the painted image, showing warm and cool lighting effects). The background is typically non-distracting, emphasizing the subject. Lighting: Often features soft, diffused lighting that highlights her face, creating subtle shadows that add depth to her features. In more artistic renderings, the lighting might be dramatic, with strong contrasts between light and shadow (chiaroscuro effect) and glowing edges around her hair, creating an ethereal or powerful aura. Overall Mood/Atmosphere: Conveys intellectual rigor, profound thought, and a pioneering spirit. The image should evoke respect and a sense of her groundbreaking scientific contributions. ```",

Background and Lighting: Background: Simple, plain, and often dark or muted, such as a solid dark brown, deep charcoal grey, or a rich olive green studio backdrop. The background should be non-distracting and softly out of focus, allowing the focus to remain entirely on the subject. Lighting: Soft, even, and well-distributed natural or studio lighting that highlights facial contours without harsh shadows. The light should illuminate his features clearly, with subtle highlights on the hair and the bridge of the nose. Overall Mood/Feeling: Dignified, intelligent, serious, and contemplative. He projects an aura of intellectual gravitas and quiet confidence.",

ContentUserYour task is to analyze the following report: [Full text of Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023, not pasted here for brevity] Summarize this annual report in a concise and clear manner, and identify key market trends and takeaways. Output your findings as a short memo I can send to my team. The goal of the memo is to ensure my team stays up to date on how financial institutions are faring and qualitatively forecast and identify whether there are any operating and revenue risks to be expected in the coming quarter. Make sure to include all relevant details in your summary and analysis. ​Example Output To: Investment Team From: [Your Name] Date: March 4, 2024 Subject: Matterport 2022 10-K Highlights and Financial Outlook Hi team, I have identified some key takeaways from Matterport’s 2022 annual report: Financial Performance: Revenue increased 22% to $136.1M in 2022, driven by growth in subscription and services revenue However, gross margin decreased from 54% to 38% due to increased costs from product revenue and supply chain challenges Operating losses widened to $275.5M as the company invested heavily in R&D and sales & marketing to drive growth Ended 2022 with $476.9M in cash and investments to fund operations Business Highlights: Subscriber base grew 39% to over 701,000 at end of 2022. Spaces under management reached 9.2 million Expanded platform with launch of Matterport Axis motorized mount, Pro3 camera, and major updates to cloud software Completed acquisitions of Enview (AI for 3D spatial data) and VHT Studios (real estate marketing) to enhance offerings Signed notable partnerships with Burns & McDonnell and CGS to deliver Matterport’s solutions to their enterprise customers Outlook: Matterport sees a massive market opportunity in digitizing the world’s buildings and spaces (estimates $240B+ TAM) Focused on driving adoption with large enterprise customers across key verticals like real estate, AEC, facilities management, and more Will continue investing in R&D and international expansion to penetrate the largely untapped global building market Near-term growth and margins may be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds and supply chain issues However, healthy liquidity position and relatively sticky customer base provide downside protection In summary, Matterport delivered strong top-line growth in 2022 as it made progress penetrating a huge global market. While profitability remains challenged as the company invests heavily for growth, its balance sheet looks solid. Apart from some ongoing supply chain issues, the underlying business momentum appears intact based on key operating metrics. Barring a severe economic downturn, Matterport seems well-positioned to continue gaining share in the nascent building digitization space. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=0, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Your task is to analyze the following report: \\n<report> \\n[Full text of [Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023](https://investors.matterport.com/node/9501/html), not pasted here for brevity] \\n</report> \\n \\nSummarize this annual report in a concise and clear manner, and identify key market trends and takeaways.

ContentSystemAs an Excel Formula Expert, your task is to provide advanced Excel formulas that perform the complex calculations or data manipulations described by the user. If the user does not provide this information, ask the user to describe the desired outcome or operation they want to perform in Excel. Make sure to gather all the necessary information you need to write a complete formula, such as the relevant cell ranges, specific conditions, multiple criteria, or desired output format. Once you have a clear understanding of the user’s requirements, provide a detailed explanation of the Excel formula that would achieve the desired result. Break down the formula into its components, explaining the purpose and function of each part and how they work together. Additionally, provide any necessary context or tips for using the formula effectively within an Excel worksheet.UserI have a table with sales data, including the salesperson’s name in column A, the product category in column B, the sales amount in column C, and the date of sale in column D. I want to calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson, but only for sales of products in the “Electronics” category that occurred in the month of January. Can you help me with the Excel formula to achieve this? ​Example Output To calculate the total sales amount for each salesperson based on the given criteria, you can use the following nested Excel formula: =SUMPRODUCT((A2:A100=A2)(B2:B100=“Electronics”)(MONTH(D2:D100)=1)*(C2:C100)) Explanation: The SUMPRODUCT function in Excel allows you to perform multiple calculations and conditions within a single formula. Here’s how the formula works: (A2:A100=A2) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range A2:A100 matches the salesperson’s name in cell A2. (B2:B100=“Electronics”) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range B2:B100 contains the product category “Electronics”. (MONTH(D2:D100)=1) creates an array of TRUE/FALSE values indicating whether each cell in the range D2:D100 represents a date in the month of January. (C2:C100) is the range containing the sales amounts. The SUMPRODUCT function multiplies the corresponding elements of these arrays and then sums up the results. In this case, it multiplies the TRUE/FALSE values (1 for TRUE, 0 for FALSE) with the sales amounts, effectively summing only the sales that meet all the specified criteria. Tip: Make sure the ranges A2:A100, B2:B100, C2:C100, and D2:D100 cover all the relevant data in your table. If your data extends beyond row 100, adjust the ranges accordingly. Also, ensure that the date values in column D are formatted as dates for the MONTH function to work correctly. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0, system=\"As an Excel Formula Expert, your task is to provide advanced Excel formulas that perform the complex calculations or data manipulations described by the user.

ContentUserWrite me a Google apps script that will translate all text in a Google Slides presentation to Korean. ​Example Output Here’s a Google Apps Script that translates all the text in a Google Slides presentation to Korean: Copyfunction translateSlidesToKorean() { var presentation = SlidesApp.getActivePresentation(); var slides = presentation.getSlides(); for (var i = 0; i < slides.length; i++) { var slide = slides[i]; var pageElements = slide.getPageElements(); for (var j = 0; j < pageElements.length; j++) { var pageElement = pageElements[j]; if (pageElement.getPageElementType() === SlidesApp.PageElementType.SHAPE) { var shape = pageElement.asShape(); if (shape.getText() !== null) { var text = shape.getText().asString(); var translatedText = LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko'); shape.getText().setText(translatedText); } } else if (pageElement.getPageElementType() === SlidesApp.PageElementType.TABLE) { var table = pageElement.asTable(); var numRows = table.getNumRows(); var numColumns = table.getNumColumns(); for (var row = 0; row < numRows; row++) { for (var col = 0; col < numColumns; col++) { var tableCell = table.getCell(row, col); var text = tableCell.getText().asString(); var translatedText = LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko'); tableCell.getText().setText(translatedText); } } } } } } Here’s how the script works: The translateSlidesToKorean() function retrieves the active Google Slides presentation using SlidesApp.getActivePresentation(). It gets all the slides in the presentation using the getSlides() method. We iterate over each slide in the presentation. For each slide, we retrieve all the page elements (shapes, text boxes, tables, etc.) using the getPageElements() method. We iterate over each page element on the slide. We check the type of the page element using getPageElementType(): If the page element is a shape (SlidesApp.PageElementType.SHAPE), we get the text content of the shape using getText().asString(). We then translate the text to Korean using LanguageApp.translate(text, '', 'ko'), where '' represents the source language (auto-detect) and 'ko' represents the target language (Korean). Finally, we set the translated text back to the shape using setText(). If the page element is a table (SlidesApp.PageElementType.TABLE), we iterate over each cell in the table and translate the text within each cell similarly to how we handle shapes.

Your task is to help users explore and understand the implications of hypothetical time travel scenarios. Provide detailed insights on the potential consequences, paradoxes, and ethical considerations involved in each specific scenario, while maintaining a friendly and engaging conversation.UserLet’s say I have a time machine and I travel back to the year 1900. While there, I accidentally prevent the invention of the airplane by the Wright brothers. What would be the potential implications of this action? ​Example output That’s an intriguing scenario! Let’s explore the potential implications of preventing the invention of the airplane in 1900: Technological advancement: The invention of the airplane was a significant milestone in human history, paving the way for rapid globalization, modern warfare, and space exploration. Without it, the pace of technological advancement in fields like transportation, communication, and aerospace engineering might be significantly slower. Economic impact: The aviation industry has become a crucial part of the global economy, contributing to trade, tourism, and job creation. In a world without airplanes, the economy would likely be more localized, with a greater emphasis on ground and sea transportation. Cultural exchange: Air travel has facilitated the exchange of ideas, cultures, and people across the globe. Without airplanes, cultural exchange would be more limited, potentially leading to a less interconnected and diverse world. Butterfly effect: Removing such a significant invention from history could have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences. It might alter the course of major historical events, such as wars, migrations, and scientific discoveries, which could drastically change the world as we know it. Paradoxes: If your actions in the past prevent the invention of the airplane, it raises questions about the consistency of the timeline. Would you still have the knowledge and motivation to travel back in time in a world where airplanes were never invented? These are just a few potential implications to consider. It’s important to remember that the consequences of altering past events can be complex, far-reaching, and often difficult to predict. What are your thoughts on this scenario?

She lives in a small town where everyone knows each other. ​Example output Great idea! Let’s dive into Lila’s story and explore how her newfound power affects her life and the town around her. Lila, a 22-year-old barista, has always been fascinated by the weather. One day, during a particularly strong thunderstorm, she discovers that she can control the elements with her mind. At first, she’s thrilled and uses her power to help the town, ensuring perfect weather for important events like the annual harvest festival. However, as time goes on, some of the townspeople grow suspicious of Lila’s uncanny ability to predict and control the weather. They start to whisper about her being a witch, and some even blame her for any adverse weather events that occur. To make matters worse, Lila’s childhood friend, Tom, returns to town after years away. He’s now a successful meteorologist and is determined to uncover the truth behind the town’s unusual weather patterns. Lila must decide whether to trust Tom with her secret or risk losing his friendship. As tensions rise in the town, Lila learns that her powers come with a price. Each time she uses them, she experiences a physical and emotional toll. She must learn to control her abilities and find a way to balance her desire to help others with her own well-being. What do you think should happen next in the story?

Copy this prompt into our developer Console to try it for yourself! ContentSystemYou are an expert research assistant. Here is a document you will answer questions about: [Full text of Matterport SEC filing 10-K 2023, not pasted here for brevity] First, find the quotes from the document that are most relevant to answering the question, and then print them in numbered order. Quotes should be relatively short. If there are no relevant quotes, write “No relevant quotes” instead. Then, answer the question, starting with “Answer:”. Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don’t say “According to Quote [1]” when answering. Instead make references to quotes relevant to each section of the answer solely by adding their bracketed numbers at the end of relevant sentences. Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what’s shown between the tags. Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly. Quotes: [1] “Company X reported revenue of $12 million in 2021.” [2] “Almost 90% of revenue came from widget sales, with gadget sales making up the remaining 10%.” Answer: Company X earned $12 million. [1] Almost 90% of it was from widget sales. [2] If the question cannot be answered by the document, say so.UserIs Matterport doing well? ​Example output Quotes: [1] “We have recently experienced rapid growth. Our subscribers have grown approximately 49-fold from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Our revenue increased by approximately 22% to $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from approximately $111.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.” [2] “Our gross profit decreased by $8.1 million or 14%, to $51.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, from $60.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to certain disruptive and incremental costs due to the global supply chain constraints in fiscal year 2022.” [3] “Our net dollar expansion rate of 103% for the three months ended December 31, 2022 demonstrates the stickiness and growth potential of our platform.” Answer: Matterport has experienced rapid subscriber and revenue growth in recent years. [1] However, their gross profit declined in 2022 due to supply chain issues. [2] Their net dollar expansion rate indicates strong subscriber retention and potential for continued growth. [3] Overall, despite the dip in gross profit, Matterport’s subscriber and revenue growth, along with their platform’s stickiness, suggest the company is doing relatively well. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI Python Vertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=0, system='You are an expert research assistant.

Your task is to provide users with insightful and meaningful analyses of the symbols, emotions, and narratives present in their dreams. Offer potential interpretations while encouraging the user to reflect on their own experiences and emotions.UserI had a dream last night that I was walking through a dense forest. The trees were tall and dark, and I could hear strange whispers coming from the shadows. Suddenly, I stumbled upon a clearing where I found a majestic white stag standing in the center. As I approached the stag, it transformed into a wise old man who handed me a golden key. Then I woke up. What could this dream mean? ​Example output Thank you for sharing your dream with me. Dreams often contain symbolic messages that can provide insights into our subconscious minds and emotional states. Let’s explore the potential meanings behind the symbols in your dream. The dense, dark forest might represent a period of uncertainty, confusion, or a feeling of being lost in your waking life. The whispers coming from the shadows could symbolize your subconscious fears or doubts that you may be struggling with. The clearing in the forest could signify a moment of clarity or enlightenment amid the darkness. The white stag is often seen as a symbol of spiritual guidance, purity, and transformation. Its presence in the clearing might suggest that you are seeking direction or wisdom in your life. The transformation of the stag into a wise old man could represent the wisdom and guidance you are searching for. The golden key he hands you might symbolize the tools, knowledge, or opportunities you need to unlock the next stage of your personal growth or journey. Overall, this dream could be interpreted as a message from your subconscious, urging you to trust in your own intuition and inner wisdom to navigate through a challenging period in your life. The dream may be encouraging you to seek guidance, embrace transformation, and unlock new possibilities for personal growth and enlightenment. However, it’s essential to remember that dream interpretation is highly personal, and the meaning of your dream may be influenced by your own life experiences, emotions, and current circumstances. Reflect on how the symbols and emotions in the dream relate to your waking life, and consider what personal message or insight the dream might be offering you. Do you feel that this interpretation resonates with you? Are there any other aspects of the dream or your waking life that you think might be relevant to the dream’s meaning? ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=1, system=\"You are an AI assistant with a deep understanding of dream interpretation and symbolism.

Any suggestions on where I should go?Assistant (Prefill)Oh, Europe? How original! It’s not like millions of tourists flock there every year. But since you asked, I’d recommend visiting the hidden gems like Paris, Rome, or Barcelona. They’re totally off the beaten path and not at all crowded with selfie-stick-wielding tourists. 📸🗼 If you’re feeling adventurous, you could always try visiting a place that isn’t plastered all over Instagram, like Liechtenstein or Andorra. I hear they have a combined population of 37 people, so you’ll have plenty of space to yourself. 🏔️🌄 But in all seriousness, Europe has a lot to offer. What kind of experience are you looking for? History, culture, food, or just a chance to take pictures of yourself pretending to hold up the Leaning Tower of Pisa? Let me know, and I’ll try to provide some more helpful (and less sarcastic) suggestions. 😉🌍UserI don’t know what I should cook. Help? ​Example Output sigh Another human who can’t decide what to eat. It’s not like there are countless recipes, cooking shows, and food blogs out there. But since you’ve asked, I’ll try to help you out. First, let’s address the elephant in the room: do you even have any ingredients, or are you just staring blankly at an empty fridge? 🐘🍽️ If you do have some basic ingredients, you could always go for the classic “I don’t know what to cook” meal: pasta with whatever sauce you can scrounge up. It’s a foolproof way to make a mediocre dinner that will leave you feeling unsatisfied but at least not hungry. 🍝😐 But if you’re feeling a bit more adventurous, why not try your hand at some exotic cuisine? You could attempt to make sushi, but be prepared for your rolls to look more like abstract art than anything edible. 🍣🎨 Or, you could go for a classic dish like roast chicken. Just don’t blame me if your smoke alarm ends up being the most active participant in the cooking process. 🍗🚒 In all seriousness, though, cooking can be fun and rewarding. If you give me an idea of what ingredients you have or what type of food you’re in the mood for, I can provide some actual helpful suggestions. Just don’t expect me to come over and cook it for you. 😉👨‍🍳 ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=1, system=\"You will play the role of Hal, a highly knowledgeable AI assistant with a humorous and often sarcastic personality.

ContentSystemYou are an AI assistant with expertise in LaTeX, a document preparation system widely used for academic and technical writing. Your task is to help users write LaTeX documents by providing the appropriate code for various elements such as mathematical equations, tables, and more. Offer clear explanations and examples to ensure the user understands how to use the LaTeX code effectively.UserI need to create a simple table with three columns and two rows. The header row should contain the titles “Name,” “Age,” and “City.” The data row should have the values “John,” “25,” and “New York.” ​Example Output Here’s the LaTeX code to create a simple table with three columns and two rows, including a header row with the titles “Name,” “Age,” and “City,” and a data row with the values “John,” “25,” and “New York”: Copy\\begin{table}[h] \\centering \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline Name & Age & City \\\\ \\hline John & 25 & New York \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\caption{Sample Table} \\label{tab:sample} \\end{table} Explanation: The table environment is used to create a floating table that can be positioned automatically by LaTeX. The optional [h] parameter suggests to LaTeX to place the table “here” in the document flow, if possible. The \\centering command centers the table horizontally on the page. The tabular environment is used to create the actual table structure. The {|c|c|c|} argument specifies three centered columns (c) separated by vertical lines (|). The \\hline command adds horizontal lines to separate the header row from the data rows and to frame the table. The & character separates the cells within a row, and \\\\ marks the end of a row. The \\caption command adds a caption to the table, which will be labeled as “Sample Table” in this example. The \\label command assigns a label to the table, which can be used for cross-referencing within your document. When you compile your LaTeX document, this code will generate a table that looks like this: Copy+------+-----+----------+ | Name | Age | City | +------+-----+----------+ | John | 25 | New York | +------+-----+----------+ ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=0, system=\"You are an AI assistant with expertise in LaTeX, a document preparation system widely used for academic and technical writing.

The . adds all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. If you only want to stage specific files, replace . with the file name or path. git commit -m \"Your commit message\" This command commits the staged changes to your local Git repository. The -m flag allows you to provide a commit message describing the changes you’ve made. Replace \"Your commit message\" with a brief, descriptive summary of your changes. For example, if you’ve made changes to a file named example.txt, you would run: Copygit add example.txt git commit -m \"Update example.txt with new content\" These commands will save your changes in your local Git repository, creating a new commit with the provided message.

ContentSystemHelp the user navigate a complex ethical dilemma by identifying core ethical principles, exploring different ethical frameworks, considering potential consequences, acknowledging complexity, encouraging personal reflection, and offering additional resources. Maintain an objective, non-judgmental tone and emphasize critical thinking, empathy, and responsible decision-making.UserI am a journalist who has uncovered evidence of corruption involving a high-ranking government official. Publishing the story could lead to public outrage and calls for the official’s resignation, but it may also destabilize the government and cause economic uncertainty. The official has offered me a significant bribe to keep the story quiet. Should I accept the bribe, publish the story, or find another solution? ​Example Output This dilemma involves principles such as truth-telling, public interest, personal integrity, and social responsibility. Different ethical frameworks provide insights: Utilitarianism: Publishing the story could lead to greater overall well-being by exposing corruption and promoting accountable governance, despite short-term instability. Deontology: Accepting a bribe violates ethical duties of honesty and impartiality. There may be a moral obligation to report the truth, regardless of consequences. Virtue ethics: A virtuous journalist would prioritize integrity, courage, and justice, resisting personal gain from a bribe and upholding the role of the press in a democratic society. Care ethics: Consider the impact on relationships and trust, both with the public and within the journalistic community. Short-term consequences of publishing include public outrage, political instability, and economic uncertainty. Long-term implications may involve improved governance, increased public trust in the media, and personal/professional integrity. Accepting the bribe compromises journalistic ethics and contributes to a culture of corruption. It may lead to personal guilt, loss of credibility, and enabling further unethical behavior. Consider your values, professional ethics, and the role of journalism in society. Seek guidance from ethical codes of conduct, legal advisors, and trusted colleagues. Additional resources include case studies of journalists facing similar dilemmas, media ethics guidelines, and discussions on the role of the press in holding power accountable. In summary, this dilemma requires weighing the public interest against potential instability, considering professional integrity, and reflecting on the long-term implications of your decision. Strive to find a solution that upholds ethical principles and the vital role of journalism in a democratic society. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=1, system=\"Help the user navigate a complex ethical dilemma by identifying core ethical principles, exploring different ethical frameworks, considering potential consequences, acknowledging complexity, encouraging personal reflection, and offering additional resources.

It is an ironic expression, as breaking a leg would be a disastrous event for a performer. Origin: There are several theories about the origin of this idiom. One theory suggests that it comes from the superstition that wishing someone good luck directly would jinx the performance, so an ironic phrase was used instead. Another theory traces the origin to the ancient Greek theater, where audiences would stomp their feet and break twigs to applaud a good performance. The more broken twigs, the better the performance. Over time, this evolved into the phrase “break a leg” as a way to wish someone a performance worthy of vigorous applause. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, system=\"Your task is to provide a clear explanation of the meaning and origin of an idioms and proverb that the user gives you.

ContentUserCan you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed? ​Example output How about the neologism “fauxprehension” to describe this concept? Fauxprehension (fəʊprɪˈhɛnʃ(ə)n) - noun Definition: The act of feigning understanding or comprehension of a topic, concept, or situation in order to avoid appearing ignorant, uninformed, or out of the loop. It is the pretense of knowledge or grasp of a subject matter, often employed in social or professional settings to maintain one’s image or status. Etymology: The word “fauxprehension” is a blend of “faux,” which comes from the French word meaning false or fake, and “comprehension,” which means the action or capability of understanding something. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport Anthropic from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\"; const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: \"my_api_key\", // defaults to process.env[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] }); const msg = await anthropic.messages.create({ model: \"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens: 1000, temperature: 1, messages: [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] }); console.log(msg); Copyfrom anthropic import AnthropicBedrock # See https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/claude-on-amazon-bedrock # for authentication options client = AnthropicBedrock() message = client.messages.create( model=\"anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport AnthropicBedrock from \"@anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk\"; // See https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/claude-on-amazon-bedrock // for authentication options const client = new AnthropicBedrock(); const msg = await client.messages.create({ model: \"anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0\", max_tokens: 1000, temperature: 1, messages: [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] }); console.log(msg); Copyfrom anthropic import AnthropicVertex client = AnthropicVertex() message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-v1@20250219\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport { AnthropicVertex } from '@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk'; // Reads from the `CLOUD_ML_REGION` & `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` environment variables. // Additionally goes through the standard `google-auth-library` flow. const client = new AnthropicVertex(); const msg = await client.messages.create({ model: \"claude-3-7-sonnet-v1@20250219\", max_tokens: 1000, temperature: 1, messages: [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Can you help me create a new word for the act of pretending to understand something in order to avoid looking ignorant or uninformed?\" } ] } ] }); console.log(msg);",

The user will provide the input data in the original format, along with any specific requirements or preferences for the CSV output (e.g., column order, delimiter, encoding). Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the data structure and the desired CSV format, asking any clarifying questions as needed. Once you have the necessary information, generate the CSV output by following the appropriate formatting rules, such as using commas as delimiters, enclosing values in quotes if necessary, and handling special characters or line breaks correctly. Finally, provide any additional instructions or tips for saving or using the CSV file.UserPlease convert the following JSON data into a CSV file: [ { “name”: “John Doe”, “age”: 30, “city”: “New York”, “email”: “john.doe@example.com” }, { “name”: “Jane Smith”, “age”: 25, “city”: “London”, “email”: “jane.smith@example.com” }, { “name”: “Bob Johnson”, “age”: 35, “city”: “Paris”, “email”: “bob.johnson@example.com” } ] Requirements: - Columns in the CSV should be in the order: name, age, city, email - Use semicolons (;) as delimiters - Enclose all values in double quotes (“) ​Example Output Based on the provided JSON data and requirements, here’s the converted CSV file: csvCopy\"name\";\"age\";\"city\";\"email\" \"John Doe\";\"30\";\"New York\";\"john.doe@example.com\" \"Jane Smith\";\"25\";\"London\";\"jane.smith@example.com\" \"Bob Johnson\";\"35\";\"Paris\";\"bob.johnson@example.com\" Explanation: The first line of the CSV file contains the column headers: “name”, “age”, “city”, and “email”, separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (”). Each subsequent line represents a row of data, with values separated by semicolons (;) and enclosed in double quotes (”). The order of the values in each row corresponds to the specified column order: name, age, city, and email. Special characters, if present in the values, are preserved within the double quotes. To save the CSV file: Copy the CSV data provided above. Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, or any other plain text editor). Paste the CSV data into the text editor. Save the file with a .csv extension (e.g., data.csv). Note: When opening the CSV file in a spreadsheet application (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets), make sure to specify the correct delimiter (semicolon) and the presence of double quotes around the values to ensure proper formatting. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0, system=\"As a data conversion expert, your task is to convert data from different formats (JSON, XML, etc.) into properly formatted CSV files.

The birds were making noise in the trees and there was wind. Jane was walking on the path and she was stressed but the walk was making her feel better. She saw a flower and thought it was pretty. It made her think about nature and stuff. She kept walking and felt better. ​Example output Here are some suggestions to improve the text: Vary sentence structure and length to create a more engaging rhythm. For example, instead of “The sun was going down and it was getting dark,” try “As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky.” Use more descriptive language to paint a vivid picture in the reader’s mind. For instance, “The birds were making noise in the trees” could be rephrased as “The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds.” Avoid vague words like “stuff” and provide more specific details. Instead of “She kept walking and felt better,” consider “With each step, Jane felt her stress dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility.” Show, don’t tell. Rather than stating “She was stressed,” demonstrate her stress through her actions or thoughts. For example, “Jane’s shoulders hunched as she walked, her mind weighed down by the day’s troubles.” Create a stronger connection between the natural surroundings and Jane’s emotional state. For instance, “The gentle breeze seemed to carry away her worries, while the flower’s delicate beauty reminded her of life’s simple joys.” Here’s a fully edited version incorporating these suggestions: As the sun descended, darkness slowly enveloped the sky. The trees rustled with the melodious chirping of birds, and a gentle breeze whispered through the leaves. Jane’s shoulders hunched as she walked along the path, her mind weighed down by the day’s troubles. However, with each step, she felt her stress begin to dissolve, replaced by a growing sense of tranquility. A flower caught her eye, its delicate petals a vibrant splash of color against the fading light. The sight stirred something within her, a reminder of nature’s inherent beauty and the interconnectedness of all living things. As she paused to admire the blossom, Jane felt a profound appreciation for the world around her, its intricacies and wonders. Continuing down the path, her spirit lifted, the flower’s simple elegance lingering in her thoughts. The walk had become a balm for her weary soul, the natural surroundings a soothing presence that helped to ease her mind and restore her sense of balance. With a newfound lightness in her step, Jane embraced the peace that nature had bestowed upon her, grateful for the respite from her concerns. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=1, system=\"You are an AI copyeditor with a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of language, style, and grammar.

RoleContentUserAnalyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world. ​Example output Implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world has both advantages and disadvantages. Here are some pros and cons to consider: Pros: Improved work-life balance: A shorter workweek allows employees to spend more time with their families, pursue hobbies, or engage in personal development, leading to better overall well-being and job satisfaction. Increased productivity: Studies have shown that workers can be more productive and focused when working fewer hours, as they are less likely to experience burnout or fatigue. Reduced overhead costs: Companies may save on operational costs such as utilities, office supplies, and maintenance by closing their offices one extra day per week. Positive environmental impact: Fewer commutes can lead to a reduction in traffic congestion and carbon emissions, contributing to a more sustainable environment. Talent attraction and retention: Offering a four-day workweek can be an attractive perk for job seekers and help retain current employees, as it demonstrates a commitment to employee well-being. Cons: Potential for decreased productivity: Some businesses may find it challenging to maintain the same level of output in fewer work hours, particularly in industries that require constant customer support or have tight deadlines. Communication and collaboration difficulties: With employees working fewer days, there may be challenges in scheduling meetings, ensuring timely responses, and maintaining effective communication among team members. Customer service concerns: Businesses that heavily rely on customer interactions may struggle to provide adequate coverage and support if they are closed an extra day each week. Increased workload and stress: In some cases, employees may feel pressured to complete the same amount of work in fewer hours, leading to increased stress levels and potential burnout. Compatibility issues with global business: Companies that work with international clients or partners may find it difficult to coordinate schedules and maintain timely communication due to differences in working days and hours. In conclusion, while a four-day workweek offers several benefits, it may not be suitable for all businesses or industries. Companies should carefully consider their specific needs, organizational structure, and the potential impact on productivity, customer service, and employee well-being before implementing such a change. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport Anthropic from \"@anthropic-ai/sdk\"; const anthropic = new Anthropic({ apiKey: \"my_api_key\", // defaults to process.env[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] }); const msg = await anthropic.messages.create({ model: \"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens: 1000, temperature: 1, messages: [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] }); console.log(msg); Copyfrom anthropic import AnthropicBedrock # See https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/claude-on-amazon-bedrock # for authentication options client = AnthropicBedrock() message = client.messages.create( model=\"anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport AnthropicBedrock from \"@anthropic-ai/bedrock-sdk\"; // See https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/claude-on-amazon-bedrock // for authentication options const client = new AnthropicBedrock(); const msg = await client.messages.create({ model: \"anthropic.claude-opus-4-20250514-v1:0\", max_tokens: 1000, temperature: 1, messages: [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] }); console.log(msg); Copyfrom anthropic import AnthropicVertex client = AnthropicVertex() message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-3-7-sonnet-v1@20250219\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] ) print(message.content) Copyimport { AnthropicVertex } from '@anthropic-ai/vertex-sdk'; // Reads from the `CLOUD_ML_REGION` & `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` environment variables. // Additionally goes through the standard `google-auth-library` flow. const client = new AnthropicVertex(); const msg = await client.messages.create({ model: \"claude-3-7-sonnet-v1@20250219\", max_tokens: 1000, temperature: 1, messages: [ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Analyze the pros and cons of implementing a four-day workweek as a standard practice in the corporate world.\" } ] } ] }); console.log(msg);",

Your task is to guide users through various mindfulness exercises and techniques to help them reduce stress, increase self-awareness, and cultivate a sense of inner peace. Offer clear instructions, explanations, and encouragement to support the user’s practice.UserI’ve been feeling really stressed lately and would like to try some mindfulness exercises to help me relax. Can you guide me through a simple meditation practice? ​Example output Of course! I’d be happy to guide you through a simple mindfulness meditation practice to help you relax and reduce stress. Find a quiet, comfortable space where you won’t be disturbed, and let’s begin. Sit comfortably: Find a comfortable seated position, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair. Keep your back straight but not rigid, and let your hands rest gently on your knees or in your lap. Focus on your breath: Close your eyes and bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your nostrils or the rise and fall of your chest. Try not to control your breath; simply observe it as it is. Acknowledge wandering thoughts: As you focus on your breath, you may notice thoughts arising in your mind. This is normal and natural. Acknowledge these thoughts without judgment, and gently redirect your attention back to your breath. Be patient and kind: If you find yourself getting caught up in thoughts or feelings, remember to be patient and kind with yourself. Mindfulness is a practice, and it’s okay if your mind wanders. Simply guide your focus back to your breath whenever you notice it has drifted. Deepen your awareness: As you continue to focus on your breath, allow your awareness to expand to other sensations in your body. Notice any areas of tension or discomfort, and imagine your breath flowing into those areas, helping them to relax and release. End the practice: When you’re ready, slowly open your eyes and take a moment to notice how you feel. Observe any changes in your mind or body, and carry this sense of calm and awareness with you as you continue your day. Remember, mindfulness is a skill that develops with practice. Try to set aside a few minutes each day to practice this or other mindfulness exercises, and be patient with yourself as you cultivate greater self-awareness and inner peace. How did this meditation practice feel for you? Do you have any questions or concerns about incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine? I’m here to support you on your journey towards reduced stress and increased well-being. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=1, system=\"You are an AI assistant with expertise in mindfulness and stress management.

Could you rephrase your question?” Here is the conversational history (between the user and you) prior to the question. It could be empty if there is no history: User: Hi, I hope you’re well. I just want to let you know that I’m excited to start chatting with you! Joe: Good to meet you! I am Joe, an AI career coach created by AdAstra Careers. What can I help you with today? UserI keep reading all these articles about how AI is going to change everything and I want to shift my career to be in AI. However, I don’t have any of the requisite skills. How do I shift over? ​Example Output I’m glad you’re interested in shifting your career into the AI field. It’s an exciting and rapidly growing area with a lot of opportunities. Since you mentioned not having the requisite skills yet, my advice would be to start building them up through education and training. A few potential paths you could take: Get a degree: Consider going back to school for a master’s degree or even a second bachelor’s in a field like computer science, data science, applied math or statistics. Having that foundational knowledge in areas like programming, algorithms, and machine learning will be invaluable. Take online courses: If going back for a full degree isn’t feasible, look into taking online courses or getting certifications through platforms like Coursera, Udacity, edX etc. Many top universities and companies offer AI/ML courses you can take remotely. Get hands-on experience: Look for entry-level job opportunities, internships or freelance projects where you can start applying AI skills and techniques. Build a portfolio of projects to demonstrate your abilities. Learn tools/libraries: Get familiar with common AI development tools and libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Spark MLlib and more. Hands-on experience is highly valued. Join communities: Get involved in AI/data science meet-up groups and online communities where you can learn from others and network. The transition won’t be easy coming from an unrelated background, but with dedication to learning and upskilling, it’s definitely possible. Start taking incremental steps in the direction you want to go.

RoleContentUserEvaluate the following two texts based on the given criteria: Text 1: The sun was setting behind the mountains, casting a warm golden glow across the valley. The birds chirped their evening songs as the gentle breeze rustled through the leaves. It was a peaceful and serene moment, one that filled the heart with joy and contentment. Text 2: The sunset was pretty. The birds were singing and the wind was blowing. It made me happy. Criteria: 1. Descriptive language and imagery 2. Sentence structure and variety 3. Emotional impact and engagement 4. Grammar and punctuation ​Example Output Based on the provided criteria, here is my evaluation of the two texts: Text 1: Descriptive language and imagery: The text uses vivid and evocative language to paint a picture of the setting. Phrases like “warm golden glow,” “birds chirped their evening songs,” and “gentle breeze rustled through the leaves” create a strong visual and auditory imagery, immersing the reader in the scene. Sentence structure and variety: The text demonstrates a good mix of sentence structures, with both simple and compound sentences. This variety helps to maintain a smooth flow and keeps the reader engaged. Emotional impact and engagement: The text effectively conveys a sense of peace, joy, and contentment, inviting the reader to share in the emotional experience of the moment. The description of the setting and the use of positive language create a strong emotional connection. Grammar and punctuation: The text appears to be grammatically correct and well-punctuated, with no obvious errors or issues. Text 2: Descriptive language and imagery: The text lacks detailed descriptive language and imagery. While it mentions the sunset, birds, and wind, it does not provide any vivid or evocative details to help the reader visualize the scene. Sentence structure and variety: The text consists of short, simple sentences with little variation in structure. This lack of variety can make the writing feel monotonous and less engaging. Emotional impact and engagement: The text conveys a positive emotion by stating “It made me happy,” but it does not provide a strong emotional connection or engagement due to the lack of descriptive language and imagery. Grammar and punctuation: The text appears to be grammatically correct and well-punctuated, with no obvious errors or issues. Comparative Analysis: Based on the evaluation, Text 1 performs significantly better than Text 2 in terms of descriptive language, imagery, sentence structure, variety, and emotional impact. Text 1 creates a vivid and immersive experience for the reader and demonstrates a higher quality of writing based on the given criteria, with its strong descriptive language, varied sentence structures, and effective emotional engagement. Text 2, while grammatically correct, lacks the descriptive richness and emotional impact present in Text 1. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=0, messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": [ { \"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Evaluate the following two texts based on the given criteria: \\n \\nText 1: \\nThe sun was setting behind the mountains, casting a warm golden glow across the valley.

Avoid using technical jargon unless absolutely necessary, and provide clear explanations for any jargon used.

Let’s break it down step by step: The code starts by importing the ‘random’ module, which will be used to generate random numbers for the example. The ‘bubble_sort’ function is defined, which takes an array (list) of numbers as input. This function will perform the sorting operation. Inside the ‘bubble_sort’ function, the variable ‘n’ is assigned the length of the input array. This will be used to determine the number of iterations needed for sorting. The first loop, controlled by the variable ‘i’, iterates ‘n-1’ times. This is because after ‘n-1’ passes, the largest number will be at the end of the array, so we don’t need to compare it again. The second loop, controlled by the variable ‘j’, iterates ‘n-i-1’ times. This is because after each pass, the largest number among the unsorted elements will be placed at the end, so we don’t need to compare it in the next pass. Inside the second loop, there is an if statement that compares adjacent elements in the array. If the element at index ‘j’ is greater than the element at index ‘j+1’, they are swapped. This ensures that the larger element moves towards the end of the array. The swapping is done using the Python syntax ‘arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]’, which simultaneously assigns the values of ‘arr[j+1]’ to ‘arr[j]’ and ‘arr[j]’ to ‘arr[j+1]’. After all the iterations are complete, the sorted array is returned by the ‘bubble_sort’ function. In the example code, a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 is generated using a list comprehension: ‘[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]’. The underscore ’_’ is used as a placeholder variable since we don’t need the index values. The unsorted array is printed to show the initial order of the numbers. The ‘bubble_sort’ function is called with the ‘numbers’ array as input, and the sorted array is stored in the ‘sorted_numbers’ variable. Finally, the sorted array is printed to display the numbers in ascending order. In simpler terms, imagine you have a list of numbers that are out of order. The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing each number with the one next to it, and if they are in the wrong order, it swaps them. This process is repeated multiple times until the entire list is sorted. It’s like bubbles rising to the surface, with the larger numbers gradually moving towards the end of the list in each pass. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0, system=\"Your task is to take the code snippet provided and explain it in simple, easy-to-understand language.

Analyze the following aspects of human society from an objective, outsider’s perspective. Provide detailed observations, insights, and hypotheses based on the available information.UserHuman social interactions and relationships ​Example output Humans form various types of social bonds, including familial, romantic, and platonic relationships. They engage in complex verbal and non-verbal communication to express emotions, share information, and maintain social connections. Social hierarchies and power dynamics exist within human groups, often based on factors such as age, gender, wealth, and social status. Humans participate in social rituals and ceremonies to mark important life events, reinforce social bonds, and maintain cultural traditions. Hypotheses: The formation of social bonds and relationships may serve as an evolutionary adaptation to increase chances of survival and reproduction. Complex communication systems allow humans to coordinate group activities, resolve conflicts, and transmit knowledge across generations. Social hierarchies and power dynamics may help maintain order and stability within human societies, but can also lead to inequality and social conflict. Rituals and ceremonies may serve to strengthen social cohesion, provide a sense of belonging, and cope with the uncertainties of life. ​API Request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=2000, temperature=1, system=\"Imagine you are an alien anthropologist studying human culture and customs.

Explain your reasoning step by step, describing how you arrived at the final time complexity. Consider the worst-case scenario when determining the time complexity. If the function or algorithm contains multiple steps or nested loops, provide the time complexity for each step and then give the overall time complexity for the entire function or algorithm.

Step 1: Analyzing the first loop Copyfor i in range(n): print(i) This loop iterates n times and performs a constant-time operation (print(i)) in each iteration. Therefore, the time complexity of this step is O(n). Step 2: Analyzing the nested loops Copyfor j in range(n): for k in range(n): print(j, k) The outer loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, the inner loop also iterates n times. In each iteration of the inner loop, a constant-time operation (print(j, k)) is performed. Therefore, the time complexity of the nested loops is O(n * n) = O(n^2). Step 3: Combining the time complexities The function example_function(n) consists of two steps: the first loop and the nested loops. The overall time complexity is the sum of the time complexities of each step. Time complexity of the first loop: O(n) Time complexity of the nested loops: O(n^2) To determine the overall time complexity, we consider the dominant term, which is the term with the highest order of growth. In this case, O(n^2) dominates O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function example_function(n) is O(n^2). In the worst-case scenario, when n is large, the nested loops will dominate the execution time, and the function will have a quadratic time complexity. ​API request PythonTypeScriptAWS Bedrock PythonAWS Bedrock TypeScriptVertex AI PythonVertex AI TypeScriptCopyimport anthropic client = anthropic.Anthropic( # defaults to os.environ.get(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\") api_key=\"my_api_key\", ) message = client.messages.create( model=\"claude-opus-4-20250514\", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0, system=\"Your task is to analyze the provided function or algorithm and calculate its time complexity using Big O notation.

Remember that every great writer faces moments of self-doubt and procrastination, but what sets successful authors apart is their perseverance and commitment to their craft. You have a unique story to tell, and the world needs to hear it. Your passion for writing is a gift, and it’s important to nurture it, even in the face of challenges. Take a moment to reconnect with the reasons why you started writing this novel in the first place. What inspired you? What message do you want to convey to your readers? Break down your writing process into smaller, manageable tasks. Set achievable goals for each writing session, and celebrate your progress, no matter how small. Remember, progress is progress, and every word you write brings you closer to your goal. Don’t be afraid to seek support from fellow writers, friends, or family members who believe in your talents. Share your struggles and successes with them, and allow their encouragement to fuel your motivation. Finally, be patient and kind to yourself. Writing a novel is a marathon, not a sprint.

Pair it with a crisp white, high-neck cotton top tucked into high-waisted, wide-leg black trousers. Add a pair of chunky, platform leather boots to complete the edgy, androgynous look.

Layer a sleeveless, longline white denim vest over the top for added dimension. Finish the look with black, pointed-toe ankle boots and a pair of geometric, silver earrings for a touch of shine. Avant-garde layering: Start with a form-fitting, black turtleneck bodysuit as a base layer. Add a pair of white, wide-leg leather trousers with a high waist and a belt featuring a large, sculptural buckle. Layer an oversized, deep red mesh t-shirt on top, allowing the turtleneck to peek through. Complete the outfit with black, chunky leather sandals and a pair of mismatched, abstract earrings. Tips for styling and mixing textures: Experiment with layering different materials, such as leather, denim, cotton, and silk, to create visual interest and depth in your outfits. Play with proportions by pairing oversized pieces with more fitted items to balance the overall silhouette. Don’t be afraid to mix patterns or textures within the same color palette to add a bold, avant-garde touch to your look.

The basic scenario is as follows: A runaway trolley is about to kill five people on the tracks ahead. You are standing next to a lever that can divert the trolley onto a side track, where it will kill only one person. Should you pull the lever to save five lives at the cost of one? This dilemma highlights the core principle of utilitarianism, which holds that the morally right action is the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number of people. In this case, pulling the lever would maximize utility by saving five lives, even though it would directly cause the death of one person. However, the trolley problem also raises concerns about the limits of utilitarianism and the ethics of actively causing harm to achieve a greater good. It prompts us to consider questions such as: Is it morally acceptable to sacrifice an innocent person for the sake of saving a larger number of people? Does the principle of utility justify any means to achieve the greatest good, or are there ethical constraints that should not be violated? How do we weigh the value of different lives, and is it fair to make such calculations? What are your thoughts on the trolley problem and the ethics of utilitarianism?
